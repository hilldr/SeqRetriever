#+STARTUP: overview
#+TITLE: SeqRetriever
#+AUTHOR: David R. Hill and Shrikar Thodla
#+EMAIL: hilldr@med.umich.edu
* Aims
High throughput RNA sequencing is an incredibly powerful tool for characterizing gene expression events ranging in scale from the complete transcriptome of an organism or tissue to the expression of a single rare RNA isoform accounting for the tiniest fraction of all trancriptional activity in a cell.  

SeqRetriever is designed to extract gene abundance data from the raw output of the [[http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/][Tophat/Cufflinks]] transcriptome assembly and abundance estimation suite and convert it into R dataframes, commonly used plots, and universal CSV output files. This allows you to ask simple questions about differences in gene expression and generate output that you can share with your colleagues, advisors, collaborators, and reviewers without requiring a degree in computer science or lengthy immersion in boring programming blogs. We get it - you have papers that needed to be written yesterday and you don't have time to learn to program. We're even okay with you analyzing these output files in Excel if you want.

There are a variety of tools available for analyzing RNA-seq datasets in the R environment, including the outstanding [[http://compbio.mit.edu/cummeRbund/][CummeRbund]] package designed for analyzing Cufflinks output which we highly recommend. SeqRetriever has far fewer features, focusing exclusively on differential expression analysis of assembled RNA-seq datasets. SeqRetriever aims to be the first R package you run to answer a brand new question about gene expression differences, but probably not the last one. This package is designed to get you asking, answering, refining, and re-asking your questions as quickly as possible.

* Design criteria
All functions in the SeqRetriever package are designed with the following criteria in mind:

1. Approachable - Anyone can generate meaningful, high quality data from RNA-seq datasets.
2. Productive - Functions should be simple and intuitive. You shouldn't have to pull up ?SeqDataframe in every R session. SeqRetriever functions should free your mind to think about science, not programming.
3. Readable - Good R script is easy to follow and, therefore, easier to share and debug. While discrete functions in SeqRetriever can be sequenced together in a pipeline to perform complex tasks, the induvidual SeqRetriever functions perform simple tasks and can be used independently of other SeqRetriever functions.

* Examples

** Setup database
#+begin_src R :session *R* :exports code :eval yes
library(SeqRetriever)
getSRexample() # Downloads and unpacks example dataset in working directory
testdf <- SeqDataframe(dir = "./norm_out") # format dataframe
#+end_src
** Select genes
#+begin_src R :session *R* :exports code :eval yes
genes <- SeqGenes(df = testdf,gene.names = c("OR4F5","SAMD11","AJAP1","SKI","ESPN", "CNKSR1"))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
** Print boxplot
#+begin_src R :session *R* :exports both :results graphics :file ./img/boxplots.png :width 800 :height 800 :eval yes
plot <- SeqBoxplot(genes)
print(plot)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:./img/boxplots.png]]
** Print Heatmap
#+begin_src R :session *R* :exports both :results graphics :file ./img/heatmap.png :width 800 :height 400 :eval yes
SeqHeatmap(genes)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:./img/heatmap.png]]

*** Print pHeatmap
This is an alternate implementation of the heatmap output using the library "pheatmap". This method will return high quality plots but lacks the flexibility of the standard ggplot2 format output returned by SeqHeatmap()
#+begin_src R :session *R* :exports both :results graphics :file ./img/pheatmap.png :eval yes
SeqpHeatmap(genes, hm.name = "pheatmap.png", w = 7, h = 3)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:./img/pheatmap.png]]


** Print boxplot showing only genes that differ significantly between "HLO" and "Lung_A"
#+begin_src R :session *R* :exports both :results graphics :file ./img/sig-boxplots.png :width 800 :height 400 :eval yes
sig.genes <- SeqStatSubset(genes, limit = 0.001, group1 = "HLO", group2 = "Lung_A")
plot2 <- SeqBoxplot(sig.genes, nrow = 1)
print(plot2)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:./img/sig-boxplots.png]]

** Using [[https://github.com/smbache/magrittr][magrittr]] syntax
SeqRetriever is designed with [[https://github.com/smbache/magrittr][magrittr]] syntax in mind. You may find that this improved the readability of your work in SeqRetriever. For example:
#+begin_src R :session *R* :exports both :results graphics :file ./img/magrittr-boxplots.png :width 800 :height 400 :eval yes
library(magrittr)
SeqDataframe(dir = "./norm_out") %>% # Create the dataframe
    SeqGenes(gene.names = c("PAX7", "CDA", "TCEB3",
                            "EXTL1", "HES3", "DFFB")) %>% # select genes to plot
    SeqBoxplot(nrow = 2, size = 2) %>% # generate boxplot and pass to print
    print()
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:./img/magrittr-boxplots.png]]

Here is another example using the SeqStatSubset() function to plot only highly significant genes as a heatmap
#+begin_src R :session *R* :exports both :results graphics :file ./img/magrittr-heatmap.png :width 800 :height 800 :eval yes
library(magrittr)
SeqDataframe(dir = "./norm_out") %>%
    SeqStatSubset(limit = 0.001,
                  Bonferroni = TRUE,
                  group1 = "ES", group2 = "HLO") %>%
    SeqHeatmap() %>%
    print()
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:./img/magrittr-heatmap.png]]

Now lets try modifying the heatmap with ggplot2 as an illustration of the flexibility of SeqHeatmap
#+begin_src R :session *R* :exports both :results graphics :file ./img/magrittr-heatmap2.png :width 800 :height 800 :eval yes
df <- SeqDataframe(dir = "./norm_out") 
df <- SeqStatSubset(df,limit = 0.001,
                  Bonferroni = TRUE,
                  group1 = "ES", group2 = "HLO")
plot <- SeqHeatmap(df)

# make a custom color spectrum 
library(RColorBrewer)
# These are the colors used in SeqpHeatmap()
colors <- colorRampPalette(rev(brewer.pal(n=7, name="RdYlBu")))(300)

plot <- plot + scale_fill_gradient2("Z- score",low=colors[1], high=colors[300], mid=colors[150]) +
    xlab("") + ylab("") +
    theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 18, face ="bold"),
          axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1),
          legend.title = element_text(size = 18, face ="bold"),
          legend.text = element_text(size = 12, face ="bold"))

print(plot)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:./img/magrittr-heatmap2.png]]

An alternate approach using magrittr syntax. This will produce a plot identical to the one above.
#+begin_src R :session *R* :exports code 
# make a custom color spectrum 
library(RColorBrewer)
# These are the colors used in SeqpHeatmap()
colors <- colorRampPalette(rev(brewer.pal(n=7, name="RdYlBu")))(300)

library(magrittr)
plot <- SeqDataframe(dir = "./norm_out") %>%
    SeqStatSubset(limit = 0.001,
                  Bonferroni = TRUE,
                  group1 = "ES",
                  group2 = "HLO") %>%
    SeqHeatmap()
# No real advantage to magrittr for adjusting ggplot2 objects. The '+' operator already works great
plot <- plot + scale_fill_gradient2("Z-score",low=colors[1], high=colors[300], mid=colors[150]) +
    xlab("") + ylab("") +
    theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 18, face ="bold"),
          axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1),
          legend.title = element_text(size = 18, face ="bold"),
          legend.text = element_text(size = 12, face ="bold"))

print(plot)
